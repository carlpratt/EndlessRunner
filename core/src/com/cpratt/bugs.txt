1. Player lateral velocity will get stuck at 0 so you can't do anything but jump
2. (DONE) Initial platform should always be blocks so you don't fall through right away at the start
3. You're unable to save yourself if you fall and hit the side of a platform. You should be able to jump and carry yourself over and continue using a double jump
4. Framerate issues on chunk generation. Chunk generation is sometimes called twice in a row.
